# CreÐApp.ai
<b>Team Esketit's <24h hack for Innerve 2K18 Hackathon at AIT, Pune.<br></b>
This is a solution to integrate a decentralized banking system with an AI-driven and decentralized credit rating agency that helps to overcome all the shortcomings of a traditional [CRA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Credit_rating_agency).
 
## Description
CreÐApp.ai is an AI-driven credit rating agency that attempts to crowdsource the process by decentralizing it. The CRA market is mostly dominated and the should-be-public data is actually private and consumed for analytics. This subtly puts the credit rating process in the hands of Artifical Intelligence, afterall it's statistical measures that help estimate the lending risks. However, its essential that the machine learning model keeps learning keeping the analytics data public as well as encrypted. To achieve this, we use [Ethereum](https://www.ethereum.org/) as the decentralization network which uses a server ONLY for computation. It must be noted that the pravalent model is also stored on [IPFS](https://ipfs.io/) and isn't localized.
